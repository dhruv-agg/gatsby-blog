## Why and Where to Use Them
In Python, when we think of a _class_, a structure like this comes to our mind

```python
class Student():
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age, grade):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.age = age
        self.grade = grade

    def function1(arg1, arg2):
        pass
```

which is not so intuitive.
What if we could have a more intuitive & less repeatitive way of doing the same thing?

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
@dataclass
class Person:
     first_name: str  # attribute 1
     last_name: str   # attribute 2
     age: int         # attribute 3
     job: int         # attribute 4

    def function1(arg1, arg2): # functionality 1
        pass
```

Yes, we are talking about the [Data Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html).

- Less biolerplate code
- More intuitive
- Type Annotations, to help you & your text editor with better type checking & linting

---

_In this blog_, we'll focus on **why** you should use DataClasses & **where** you should use them.
For a deeper dive in DataClasses, I'll attach resources.

#### **REQUIREMENTS**

- Python 3.7+ üêç
- A zeal to learn üòä

When working with data-oriented classes, that behave like data-containers, you might want to create many instances of them ,compare, sort the objects and do a lot of data centric operations. Such functionalities are not provided right out of the box by regular classes. Data classes can hlp you achieve those functionalities with a more compact & intuitive code. 

### 1. **Less code to define a class**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
@dataclass
class Student:
     first_name: str  # attribute 1
     last_name: str   # attribute 2
     age: int         # attribute 3
     grade: int       # attribute 4
```

The dataclass decorator `@dataclass` is actually a code generator that automatically adds other methods under the hood. It adds methods like `__init__` , `__eq__` and `__repr__` and many more to your class. These methods are responsible for setting the attribute values, testing for equality and representing objects in a nice string format.

### 2. **Default values for attributes**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
@dataclass
class Student:
    first_name: str = "John"
    last_name: str = "Smith"
    age: int = 12
    grade: int = 5
```

As a general python convention, _"fields without default values cannot appear after fields with default values."_

### 3. **Customised representation of the objects**

The `__repr__()` can be modified to ovverride the default presentation of objects in the console

```python

from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class Student:
    first_name: str = "John"
    last_name: str = "Smith"
    age: int = 12
    grade: int = 5

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name} age {self.age}, studies in grade {self.grade}"


john = Student()
print(john)
# John Smith age 12, studies in grade 5
# instead of
# Student(first_name='John', last_name='Smith', age=12, grade=5)
```

The same can be achieved by using a `__str__()` which works with regular classes as well.

```python
def __str__(self) -> str:
    return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name} age {self.age}, studies in grade {self.grade}"

# John Smith age 12, studies in grade 5
```

### 4. **Easy conversion to a tuple or a dictionary**

Always converting objects to `dict` or `tuple` when interacting with other programs that expect these formats? Objects can be easily serialized into dicts or tuples using Data Classes.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from dataclasses import asdict, astuple


@dataclass
class Student:
    first_name: str = "John"
    last_name: str = "Smith"
    age: int = 12
    grade: int = 5

    # def __repr__(self):
    #     return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name} age {self.age}, studies in grade {self.grade}"


john = Student()
print(john)
print(astuple(john))
# ('John', 'Smith', 12, 5)

print(asdict(john))
# {'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Smith', 'age': 12, 'grade': 5}

```

### 5. **Create READ-only objects**

There are times when you want to prevent anyone from modifying the values of the attributes once the object is instantiated i.e. you want a `frozen` or an _immutable_ instance.

This can be achieved by using `@dataclass(frozen=True)`

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Student:
    first_name: str = "John"
    last_name: str = "Smith"
    age: int = 12
    grade: int = 5

john = Student()
print(john)

john.age = 13
```

If you set a `frozen` object‚Äôs attribute to a new value, a `FrozenInstanceError` error will be raised.

```sh
Student(first_name='John', last_name='Smith', age=12, grade=5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "student.py", line 15, in <module>
    john.age = 13
  File "<string>", line 4, in __setattr__
dataclasses.FrozenInstanceError: cannot assign to field 'age'
```

Also a `__hash__()` will be automatically created by Python when `frozen=True`

### 6. **Comparison of objects**

```python
john_again = Student(first_name='John', last_name='Smith', age=12, grade=5)

print(john == john_again)
```

In order to compare two objects `john` & `john_again`, you‚Äôd have to implement the `__eq__` method yourself.
This method should first check that the two objects are instances of the same class and then test the equality between tuples of attributes.

```python
def __eq__(self, other):
    if other.__class__ is not self.__class__:
        return NotImplemented
    return (self.first_name,
            self.last_name,
            self.age,
            self.grade) == (other.first_name,
                            other.last_name,
                            other.age,
                            other.grade)

```

Now if you decide to add new attributes to your class, you‚Äôd have to update the `__eq__()` method again. Then do the same for `__ge__()` , `__gt__()` ,`__le__()` and `__lt__()` if they‚Äôre used.

But, with DataClass, it works out of the box

```python
print(john == john_again)
# True
```

### **ADVANCED FEATURE: SORTING**

It's also possible to **sort** & **compare** objects based on an attribute as a default.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from dataclasses import field  # import field


@dataclass(order=True)  # tells dataclass that we want to compare objects
class Student:
    first_name: str = "John"
    last_name: str = "Smith"
    age: int = 12
    grade: int = 5
    sort_index: int = field(init=False, repr=False)
    # init = False, means sort_index will be initialised after 'age' is initialised
    # repr = False, means sort_index will not be printed

    def __post_init__(self):
        self.sort_index = self.age


john = Student(age=15)
print(john)
# Student(first_name='John', last_name='Smith', age=15, grade=5)

sam = Student(age=20)
print(sam)
# Student(first_name='John', last_name='Smith', age=20, grade=5)

print(sam > john)
# True
```

Here, `__gt__()` considers `age` attribute for comparison.

**QUESTION**‚ùì**How'd you sort a frozen set?**

Using the `__setattr__()`

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from dataclasses import field  # import field


@dataclass(order=True, frozen=True)  # enable order=True
class Student:
    first_name: str = "John"
    last_name: str = "Smith"
    age: int = 12
    grade: int = 5
    sort_index: int = field(init=False, repr=False)
    # init = False, means sort_index will be initialised after 'age' is initialised
    # repr = False, means sort_index will not be printed

    def __post_init__(self):
        object.__setattr__(self,'sort_index', self.age)


john = Student(age=15)
print(john)
# Student(first_name='John', last_name='Smith', age=15, grade=5)

sam = Student(age=20)
print(sam)
# Student(first_name='John', last_name='Smith', age=20, grade=5)

print(sam > john)
# True
```

### ‚≠ê**BONUS**‚≠ê

If you've read this far, here's an advanced functionality of DataClasses

### 7. **Initialize internal attributes**

In some situations, you may need to create an attribute that is only defined internally, not when the class is instantiated. The attribute has a value that can depend on previously-set attributes.  
The `__post_init__()` is called right after the `__init__()` method is called.
By using this function and setting its `init=False` and `repr=True` we can create a new field called `full_name`

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from dataclasses import field  # import field

@dataclass
class Student:
    first_name: str = "John"
    last_name: str = "Smith"
    age: int = 12
    grade: int = 5
    full_name: str = field(init=False, repr=True)

    def __post_init__(self):
         self.full_name = self.first_name + " " + self.last_name

john = Student()
print(john)
# Student(first_name='John', last_name='Smith', age=12, grade=5, full_name='John Smith')

print(john.full_name)
# John Smith
```

We can still instantiate the `Student` class without setting the `full_name` attribute.
The `repr=True` makes it visible when the object is printed.

### It's all great but where do I use it?

- If you have Python 3.7+ üòõ
- You're working on a data-centric scenario
  - It's a data-driven scenario & less behaviour-driven
  - You need to create many data-centric classes
  - Optionally, you need to ensure a degree of _immutability_ on the objects of this class.

Example from `artifacts.py` showing how Data Classes are used for data-centric classes in production code. 

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class DataIngestionArtifact:
    trained_file_path: str
    test_file_path: str


@dataclass
class DataValidationArtifact:
    validation_status: bool
    valid_train_file_path: str
    valid_test_file_path: str
    invalid_train_file_path: str
    invalid_test_file_path: str
    drift_report_file_path: str


@dataclass
class DataTransformationArtifact:
    transformed_object_file_path: str
    transformed_train_file_path: str
    transformed_test_file_path: str

```
